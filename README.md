# Hello, World!

Hi, my name is Henrik :wave: I am a student from northern Germany and born in 2003. Coding is how I can express my mind. That's why I love it so much :heart: I enjoy creating web apps with React and TypeScript as much as I love to write iOS and macOS Apps with Swift. While I do so I am always looking for other languages or frameworks I can learn to unlock more possibilities to express my creativity. It's so exiting!<br />

=> Check out my portfolio website [thoroee.com](https:://www.thoroee.com) and have a detailed look at all (most) of my projects and my CV.

## What I Love :heart:
- Solving tricky problems and seeing my solution to work
- Creating stunning UIs 
- Learning new exiting stuff all day
- Everything with numbers 
    - Physics, Informatics and of course Math itself
